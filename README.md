SymfonyPlugin
=============
[ShieldBreaker][1] plugin to perform a Brute Force attack on Symfony-based-websites.

**Only use for granted tests !**

Notice that you'll have to import a `shieldbreaker_X.jar` (X >= _Beta1.0_) as a lib to build it.
Please do not put the `shieldbreaker_X.jar` in the compiled plugin.
